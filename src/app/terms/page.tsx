                Pledge is listed on an exchange, Pledge will experience similar
                volatility and will be subject to the same factors faced by
                other cryptocurrencies. Recognize also that the cost of
                transactions on such technologies is variable and can increase
                at any time, causing an impact on any activities that take place
                on blockchains.
              </p>

              <p>
